- Both backend and frontend are containerized with Docker for consistency.  
- Integrated with Docker Compose for testing.  

## Running with Docker
NOTE: You must have a spotify developer's account to run this project.

These are only instructions for testing the project, not deploying.

PREREQUISITES: Make sure to have docker and python installed on your desktop. And also download [this dataset](https://www.mediafire.com/file/9dcqyt1qbfgx1rj/dataset.csv/file) and put it in the frontend folder as `dataset.csv` (original dataset was taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset))

### 1. Configure Environment Files
1. Go to the backend directory and make a new folder there named "run", inside it make another folder "secrets". Finally, inside the secrets folder make the file "API_KEY.env", it must look like this:
```env
API_KEY = CUSTOM API KEY OF YOUR BACKEND
```
2. Make a file in the frontend directory ".env" with this info:
```env
client_id = SPOTIFY DEV CLIENT ID

client_secret = SPOTIFY DEV CLIENT SECRET

API_KEY = CUSTOM API KEY OF YOUR BACKEND

API_URL = URL TO BACKEND i.e https://backend.com/predict (only required if you're using this outside of testing)
```
### 2. Run the Project (Must have Docker installed)
```bash
# NOTE: From project root
docker build -t snare-frontend ./frontend
docker build -t snare-backend ./backend
docker-compose up
```
